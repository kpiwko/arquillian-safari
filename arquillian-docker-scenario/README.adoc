= Arquillian Docker Scenario

This project shows how to use Docker to bring you preconfigured system under test.

Docker is used to provide:
* WildFly 8 container
* H2 database

Test deploys a simple WAR with a servlet to the WildFly 8 instance. Arquillian Cube controls
both WildFly and H2 Docker images, loading WAR into Arquillian WildFly container that is running
inside of docker

[NOTE]
====
You need to enable TCP/IP socket in Docker. See more details at https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube
