= Arquillian REST Scenario

This project shows how to use Spock framework in order to get BDD tests written in Groovy working with Arquillian. RESTAssured framework
is used to excercise REST endpoints.

Additionally, this example uses Arquillian Byteman plugin to inject a fault into bytecode of the application running on the server
and asserting that error gets propagated back to test.

The example is using following architecture:

* WAR application running on application server
* REST services exposed for both Web UI
* JPA based datasource for data storage
