= Arquillian Browsers Scenario

This project shows a browser web UI tests written in a way they can be easily executed from command line, IDE and debugged. Additionally, this
examplem demonstrates how to run QUnit defined tests directly in the deployed application from Java related code.

Additionally, this example demonstrates _Page_ and _Fragment_ abstractions from Arquillian Graphene to encapsulate low lever
logic and keep it apart from the test itself.

The example is using following architecture:
* WAR application running on application server using Java EE 6 with responsive design
* Services exposes as REST endpoint
* JPA based datasource for data storage
* Graphene defined test for the application
* QUnit tests covering REST endpoint testing

[NOTE]
----
This test is configured to run on Firefox, Chrome and PhantomJS, however all browsers supported by Drone will do.
