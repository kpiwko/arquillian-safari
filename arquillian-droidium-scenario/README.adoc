= Arquillian Droidium Scenario

This project shows a seamless navigation in test using Android Application and web based UI as front-ends and backend running
on application servers. Test is able to perform various actions on either of the frontends and validate that the action had expected effect
on different frontend.

Additionally, this example demonstrates _Page_ and _Fragment_ abstractions from Arquillian Graphene to encapsulate low lever
logic and keep it apart from the test itself.

The example is using following architecture:
* EAR application running on application server
* REST services exposed for both Web UI and native Android Application
* JPA based datasource for data storage

[NOTE]
----
This test does not work on real devices as mobile application has hardcoded connection to +10.0.0.2+ IP address
that acts as a identifier of host machine and which is not available on real devices.
