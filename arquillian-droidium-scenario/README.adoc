= Arquillian Safari

Arquillian Safari is a show case for following test scenarios:


[horizontal]

* Functional tests for desktop and mobile browsers
* Web Page abstractions
* Easy switching between browsers

== Requirements

* Java
* Maven (version 3.0 and above)
* Android SDK and ANDROID_HOME environment variable that points to Android SDK installation directory
* Android 4.2.2 libraries installed in Android SDK

== Notes

This test does not work on real devices as mobile application has hardcoded connection to +10.0.0.2+ IP address
that acts as identified of host machine and which is not available on real devices.
